# GaitEvent_MultiCondition_algo

(This page is a work in progress. For the moment, the clinical version of the algorithm is available. The optimisation algorithm and the database are expected to be available in the beginning of 2025)

the Multi-Condition_algo contains:
- the matlab routine for MC7 algorithm (run on Matlab 2018a)
- a subfolder where the c3d files have to be placed (some labelled and cleaned occurences are provided)
- the markerset viewver pyCGM58.mvc for viewing C3D files in MOKKA software
